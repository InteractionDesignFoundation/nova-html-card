```

## Usage

[Register your new card](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/2.0/customization/cards.html#registering-cards).

```php
use InteractionDesignFoundation\HtmlCard\HtmlCard;

public function cards()
{
    return [
        (new HtmlCard())->width('1/3')->html('<h1>Hello World!</h1>'),
        (new HtmlCard())->width('1/3')->markdown('# Hello World!'),
        (new HtmlCard())->width('1/3')->view('cards.hello', ['name' => 'World']),
     ];
}
```

### Options

  - `->html('<h1>Hello!</h1>')`: Set HTML or plain content.
  - `->markdown('# Hello!')`: Set Markdown content that will be converted into HTML.
  - `->view('path.to.view', [])`: Specify blade view file and optionally pass an array of data to view.
- Styling
  - `->center(false)`: Center card's content. `false` by default.
  - `->withoutCardStyles(true)`: Whether to use standard Nova Card styles for a card (background, padding, etc). `false` by default.
